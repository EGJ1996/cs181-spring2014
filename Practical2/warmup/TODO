. normalize certain features: production budget, running_time

. add error bar for python plot of LWLR
. add NLTK feature extraction
. potentially add new features, like actors
. time permitting, play with different regression algorithms like SVM 

Things that didn't work that I expected to:

SVM
normalizing x_train
