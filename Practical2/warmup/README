Practical 2
David Wihl and Zack Hendlin

The warmup is implemented in two parts.

Part 1 - Octave / Matlab

This implements a variety of basis functions: 
  linear (via gradient descent),
  Polynomial,
  Gaussian with Moore Penrose

To run this, start Octave / Matlab and execute main.m

Part 2 - Locally Weighted Linear Regression - Python

This implements LRLW in Python. To execute, use

   $ python lwlr.py

Both Octave and Python display the error cost calculated in 
the same manner.
