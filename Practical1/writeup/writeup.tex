%\subsection*{Basic K-Means}

\par Initially I used a K-Means implementation in Octave I had written for a previous course.\footnote{Machine Learning, Coursera, Prof. Andrew Ng, Completed Jan 2014, \url{https://class.coursera.org/ml-004}} While this implementation was sufficient for the prior course's Dataset, when I tested it with five clusters of random data, K=5 and random initial centroids, one of the centroids would frequently not converge on any points.

\end{figure}

I subsequently modified the code to use K-Medoids, choosing one of the sample data points at random as an initial centroid. This worked much better.

\subsection*{CIFAR-10 Image Data}

I then attempted using K-Medoids with the CIFAR-10 Image Data, using the Matlab version of the data with Octave. The training data consists of a 10000x3072 matrix of UInt8. Each row is a 32x32x3 (=3072) color image, consisting of 1024 red, 1024 green and 1024 blue elements. There are 10 classes in the set (``airplane'', ``automobile'', etc.), so setting K=10 was a rational first step.
