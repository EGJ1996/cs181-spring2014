Overall Code layout:

Repeat
  part a: vectorize. Add one feature at a time

  for each classifier:
	for each fold in CV set (use 5 to 10):
		run classify
	measure and log total error rate
Until we get good scores

Select winning combination of feature vector and classifier. Run against test data. Check for overfitting.
If possibly overfit, submit two different algorithms.


Data layout:

Current XML hierarchy:
+Process
	- bunch of attributes (index, username, executionStatus...)
	+ Thread
	  +all_section
	    API calls w/attributes (e.g. load_dll, open_key)

Flatten to single table consisting of:
API Call, API seq, pid, process-attr, thread-id, thread-attrs, API call attributes
