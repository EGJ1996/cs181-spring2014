open questions:
. best way to convert enums to numbers - put in a dictionary? and leave dictionary in separate YAML?
  . (currently trying Python hash() but could be improved)

Overall Code layout:

1. vectorize
2. train
  a) choose subset of feature vector
  b) train classifier(s)
3. validate
  a) try multiple folds (3,5,10)
  b) time permitting, try Leave One Out
4. compare and score
  a) select combination of features and algorithms
  b) perhaps do ensemble or multi votes
5. test and submit. Run against test set and produce result.

If possibly overfit, submit two different algorithms.

What Cannot be Done:
1. Permutations of all features (O(n!) problem)



Data layout:

Current XML hierarchy:
+Process
	- bunch of attributes (index, username, executionStatus...)
	+ Thread
	  +all_section
	    API calls w/attributes (e.g. load_dll, open_key)

Flatten to single table consisting of:
API Call, API seq, pid, process-attr, thread-id, thread-attrs, API call attributes
