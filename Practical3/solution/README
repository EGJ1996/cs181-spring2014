The course supplied classification_starter.py has been refactored to break into multiple pieces:

Common Files:

classifiers.py - set of classifiers

featurefunc.py - a place to put all the feature functions

util.py - course supplied

csrutil.py - small utilities for Sparse CSR matrices.

Main Files:

vectorize.py - take the huge XML files and turn them into a serialized numpy sparse vector, which takes approx 6500x times less space!

submit.py - takes the serialized output from vectorize and writes out the resulting test file for submission to Kaggle

validate.py - validate accuracy of different models. The Lab.

Scores are kept in error_log.txt
