The course supplied classification_starter.py has been refactored to break into multiple pieces:

vectorize.py - take the huge XML files and turn them into a serialized numpy sparse vector, which takes approx 6500x times less space!

featurefunc.py - a place to put all the feature functions

train.py - takes the serialized output from vectorize and writes out the resulting test file

To run:

   python vectorize.py
   python train.py

and the result (barring random value changes) will be identical to classification_starter.py
